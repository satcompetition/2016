<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
<p>
All the tracks except for the Parallel and Incremental Library Track will be run on the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp">
StarExec-cluster</a>. The solvers will be executed with a time limit of 5000 seconds and memory limit of 24GB.
The StarExec system will be also used for submitting the solvers (expect for the Parallel and Incremental Library tracks that use e-mail submission).
</p>

<h2>Usage of StarExec</h2>

<h4>Getting an acount</h4>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/registration.jsp">
Register</a> for an account in the <b>SAT community</b> (unless you are already registered).</li>
<li>Wait until one of the SAT community leaders (Marijn Heule and Tomas Balyo) approves your request (should not take more than 24h).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Uploading a solver for testing</h4>

<ol>
<li>The solver is submitted by uploading its source code and a build script. The solvers are then compiled by StarExec.</li>
<li>The uploaded file must have a special format (see the 
<a href="https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/stardev/User+Guide#UserGuide-Uploading">
StarExec User Guide</a> for details, here is an <a href="downloads/mini.zip">example with minisat</a>).
</li>
<li>Login to StarExec and click Spaces->Explore (on the top) then on the left open root->SAT->Sat2016Testing</li>
<li>On the bottom of page at right side click "upload solver" to open upload dialog.</li>
<li>Click "Browse" and select the zip file with your solvers code, enter the solver name, change downloadable to "no" (otherwise everyone can see you source code) and click "upload".</li>
</ol>

<h4>Testing your solver</h4>
<p>We put a few testing instances in the Sat2016Testing space which you can use if you uploaded your solver to this space. To run a test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the root->SAT->Sat2016Testing space.</li>
<li>Click "create job" on the bottom of the page. This opens a page where you don't need to change anything so just click "next"</li>
<li>On the next page select the "choose" option and then "all in Sat2016Testing"</li>
<li>A page with all solvers (and their configurations) comes up, select the solver you want to run and click "submit"</li>
<li>You can check out the status and results of your test job by clicking on Jobs on the top and selecting your job.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Outputing proofs in the Main Track</h4>
<p>The proof for UNSAT instances must be written in a file called <b>proof.out</b> and placed in the folder which your start script gets as the second parameter ($2). Thefore
your starexec_run_default should contain something like 
<pre>#!/bin/bash
./solver $1 --proof-file=$2/proof.out</pre></p>

<h4>Uploading the final version of your solver</h4>
<p>instructions comming soon</p>

<ul>
<li>The uploaded file must have a special format (see the 
<a href="https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/stardev/User+Guide#UserGuide-Uploading">
StarExec User Guide</a> for details, here is an <a href="downloads/minisat220.zip">example with minisat</a>).
</li>
<li>The binaries should be statically linked in order to avoid problems with missing libraries.</li>
<li>The binaries must be compatible with the 
<a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/machine-specs.txt">StarExec machine specifications</a>.</li>
<li>We recommend to select "run test job = yes" with "setting profile = SAT" when uploading a solver. This creates a test job that
runs the newly upladed solver on a random 3SAT formula with 100 variables (10 seconds time limit). If the test job fails
your solver binary is probably not compatible with starexec.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.starexec.org/vmimage/">virtual machine image</a> that matches StarExec
can be useful for compiling the proper binary.</li>

<li>Send an email to satrace2015@googlegroups.com with your system description (see <a href="#general">general rules</a>) 
and (optionally) your source code.</li>
