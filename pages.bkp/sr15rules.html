</h3>
<h4>Participants</h4>
<p>
Each participant of the SAT-Race 2015 must submit a short (1-2 pages pdf-file) description of his system(s).
This should include a list of all authors of the system and their present institutional affiliations.
It should also describe any algorithms or data structures that are not standardly used in such systems.
See system descriptions from <a href="index.php?cat=previous">
previous competitions</a> for examples. System descriptions will be posted on the SAT-Race 2015 website.
</p>
<p>
Submitters are encouraged to be physically present at the SAT'15 conference.
This is, however, not a requirement to participate or win.
</p>
<p>
There will be three tracks (see below) where participants can submit their solvers independently.
</p>

<h4>Important Dates</h4>
<p>The following dates apply for each track.</p>

<p>*By registration we mean creating a StarExec account and sending an email (to satrace2015@googlegroups.com) with the list of tracks you want to participate in.</p>

<h4>Benchmark Selection</h4>
<p>
The benchmark problems for the Main and Parallel tracks will be selected from 
problems used in previous competitions and newly submitted benchmarks (see the
<a href="#main">next section</a> for more information on submitting benchmarks).
The following selection method will be applied:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We randomly select 3 out of the top 7 solvers from the previous competition 
(<a href="http://satcompetition.org/edacc/sc14/experiment/20/ranking/">
Sequential, Application SAT+UNSAT track of SAT Competition 2014</a>).</li>
<li>We run the selected solvers on all the benchmarks with a 1 hour time limit.</li>
<li>We define the hardness of an instance as the total time the
three solvers spent on it (maximum is 3 hours in the case that none of the solvers
could solve the instance within the time limit).</li>
<li>Using the hardness, we randomly select 300 instances based on a 
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+normal+distribution+sigma%3D1+mu%3D1.5">
normal distribution with mean 1.5 and standard deviation 1</a>.</li>
<li>Those 300 instances will be used for the Main Track.</li>
<li>The top 100 hardest instances out of the 300 will be used for the Parallel Track.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The benchmarks for the Incremental Library Track are applications using a SAT solver in an
incremental fashion. See the <a href="#api">Incremental Library Track Rules</a> section for more information.
</p>


<h4>Evaluation and Prizes</h4>
<p>
The solvers will be compared based on the number of problem instances they can solve within
the time limit of one hour. For each track there will be four prizes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The first three prizes will be given based on the number of solved instances 
within a given time limit. The top three solvers that solve the highest number of instances will receive
these prizes. Ties will be broken based on total runtime.
</li>
<li>
There will be a fourth (special) prize per
track for the "most innovative" solver by a ranking method that uses the number of
solved instances not solved by the top three solvers of the track (determined by the ranking above).
Each solver will get:
<ul>
<li>4 points for each solved instance that was not solved by any of the top three solvers</li>
<li>2 points for each solved instance that was solved by exactly one of the top three solvers</li>
<li>1 point for each solved instance that was solved by exactly two of the top three solvers</li>
<li>0 points for each solved instance that was solved by all of the top three solvers</li>
</ul>
The special prize will be awarded to the the solver receiving the highest number of points.
Ties will be broken based on total runtime.
</ul>

<h4><a name="Portfolios">Portfolios</a></h4>
<p>
Portfolio SAT solvers (consisting of different core SAT solvers) may participate in the Race.
Before including a SAT solver in your portfolio please consult the license/author of the given
SAT solver whether such usage is allowed.
</p>
<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<p>
We reserve the right to not accept more than two solvers from one submitter per track.

<h3><a name="main">Main Track Rules</a></h3>

<h4>Submission and Execution Environment</h4>
<p>
The Main track will be run on the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp">
StarExec-cluster</a>. In order to participate you must:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/registration.jsp">
Register</a> for an account in the <b>SAT community</b> (unless you are already registered).</li>
<li>Wait until one of the SAT community leaders approves your request (should not take more than 24h).</li>
<li>Upload your solver binary into the subspace called "SatRace2015" (root/SAT/SatRace2015).
<ul>
<li>The uploaded file must have a special format (see the 
<a href="https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/stardev/User+Guide#UserGuide-Uploading">
StarExec User Guide</a> for details, here is an <a href="downloads/minisat220.zip">example with minisat</a>).
</li>
<li>The binaries should be statically linked in order to avoid problems with missing libraries.</li>
<li>The binaries must be compatible with the 
<a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/machine-specs.txt">StarExec machine specifications</a>.</li>
<li>We recommend to select "run test job = yes" with "setting profile = SAT" when uploading a solver. This creates a test job that
runs the newly upladed solver on a random 3SAT formula with 100 variables (10 seconds time limit). If the test job fails
your solver binary is probably not compatible with starexec.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.starexec.org/vmimage/">virtual machine image</a> that matches StarExec
can be useful for compiling the proper binary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send an email to satrace2015@googlegroups.com with your system description (see <a href="#general">general rules</a>) 
and (optionally) your source code.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Input and Output Format</h4>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2004/format-solvers2004.html">input
and output format requirements</a> are the same as those used for the SAT Competitions.
</p>

<h4>Benchmark Submission</h4>
<p>
The benchmarks are submitted using the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp">StarExec</a> system.
The instructions for submitting a benchmark set are:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/registration.jsp">

<h3><a name="parallel">Parallel Track Rules</a></h3>

<h4>Execution Environment</h4>
<p>
For the Parallel Track we have two stages, the first stage with 8 core computers and the
second stage with 64 core computers. Due to resource constraints only the best 8 solvers 
from the first stage (based on the highest number of solved instances) will participate in the second stage.
The winners (all four prizes) will be selected from the solvers participating in the second stage.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The First Stage will be run on 8 core machines. The configuration of the used computers is the following:<br>
CPU: 2x Intel Xeon E5430, 2.66 GHz (8 physical cores).<br>
Memory: 32 GB (24 GB memory limit for solver processes enforced).<br>
</li>
<li>
The Second Stage will be run on 64 core machines with the following configuration:<br>
CPU: 4x Intel Xeon E5-4640, 2.4 GHz (32 physical + 32 hyper-threading cores).<br>
Memory: 512 GB
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The participating solvers will receive a second command line argument indicating the number
of available cores (8 or 64), the first argument is the cnf input file as usual.
</p>

<h4>Submission</h4>
In order to participate in the Parallel Track please send a zip archive to satrace2015@googlegroups.com containing:
<ul>
<li>The source code of the solver with a makefile
<ul>
<li>Running "make" should result in creating an executable file "solver" in the same directory</li>
<li>The executable "solver" takes two parameters: the input file and the number of cores (see below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The system description of the solver (see <a href="#general">general rules</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Input and Output Format</h4>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2004/format-solvers2004.html">input
and output format requirements</a> are the same as those used for the SAT Competitions except
for a special second argument indicating the number of available cores.<br>
Example: <code> "./solver dimacs.cnf 64" </code> runs a solver named "solver" on a cnf file
named "dimacs.cnf" on a machine with 64 cores.
</p>

<h3><a name="api">Incremental Library Track Rules</a></h3>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
Many applications of SAT are based on solving a sequence of incrementally generated SAT instances.
In such scenarios the SAT solver is invoked multiple times on the same formula under different assumptions.
Also the formula is extended by adding new clauses and variables between the invocations. It is possible
to solve such problem by solving the incrementally generated instances independently, however this might be
very inefficient compared to an incremental SAT solver, which can reuse knowledge acquired while solving the previous
instances (for example the learned clauses).
</p>
<p>
There are several SAT solvers that support incremental SAT solving, however each has its own interface, which
differs from the others. That makes comparing them difficult. Our goal is to have a single interface implemented by
many different solvers. Users who want to use incremental SAT solvers in their applications would also benefit
from such an interface. Applications could be written without selecting the concrete incremental SAT solver
in advance and migrating to a different solver would be just a matter of updating linking parameters.
</p>

<h4>The Proposed Interface - IPASIR</h4>
<p>
The name of the proposed interface is IPASIR, which is the reversed acronym for "Re-entrant Incremental Satisfiability Application Program Interface".
With an additional space and question mark it can also serve as an expression for offering a brewed beverage to a gentleman.
</p>
<p>
The interface was designed to have the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement, so that SAT solver developers would be willing to support it.</li>
<li>Easy to use, so that anyone can easily build SAT based applications (can be used for educational purposes).</li>
<li>Universal and powerful, so that it can be used for a broad range of industrial and research applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The interface consists of only 9 functions which are inspired by the incremental interfaces of <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/">PicoSAT</a>
and <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/">Lingeling</a>. It is defined in the form of a C language header file <a href="downloads/ipasir.h">ipasir.h</a>.
Please refer to the comments in the header file for more information about the specifications of the interface.
</p>
<p>
We have prepared a package (<a href="downloads/ipasir.zip">ipasir.zip</a>) containing three SAT solvers adapted to IPASIR and a few simple IPASIR based applications.
One of the adapted SAT solvers in the package is <a href="http://www.sat4j.org/">Sat4j</a> which demonstrates that
not only solvers written in C/C++ can implement IPASIR. The package also contains a simple Java binding and Java application to
show how any IPASIR compatible SAT solver can be used in a Java application.
</p>

<h4>Solver Submission</h4>
<p>
In order to participate in the Incremental Library Track please follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement all the functions defined in the <a href="downloads/ipasir.h">ipasir.h</a> header file.</li>
<li>Create a directory with your code and makefile following the style of the three example solvers in
the <a href="downloads/ipasir.zip">ipasir.zip</a> package. Placing your directory in the "ipasir/sat/" directory and
issuing "make" in the "ipasir/" directory should result in a successful build of all the example
applications with your solver (and the original example solvers). See the README files located in the package
for more information.</li>
<li>Add the system description of your solver (see <a href="#general">general rules</a>) into the directory.</li>
<li>Pack your directory into a zip file and send it to satrace2015@googlegroups.com</li>
</ol>

<h4>Benchmark Submission</h4>
<p>
The benchmarks for the Incremental Library Track are command line applications that solve
a problem specified by an input file given as a parameter to the application.
Please take a look at the example applications in the <a href="downloads/ipasir.zip">ipasir.zip</a> package.
To create your own benchmark applications follow the style of the  directories in the "ipasir/app/" directory.
</p>
<p>
Prepare your application directory in such a way that placing it in the "ipasir/app/" directory and
issuing "make" in the "ipasir/" directory results in a successful build of your application (along with the original example applications)
with all the solvers in the package. Follow the instruction in the README files found in the <a href="downloads/ipasir.zip">ipasir.zip</a> package.
As the last step add a short text document that describes your application into
your directory, pack it into a zip file and send it to satrace2015@googlegroups.com.
</p>

<h4>Benchmark Selection and Evaluation of Solvers</h4>
<p>
The benchmarks used for the competition will be selected by the organizers. The solvers will be evaluated by
the number of problem instances (application + input pairs) solved within a given time limit.
