<p>
The 2016 SAT Competition is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem.
It is organized as a satellite event to the 
<a href="http://sat2016.labri.fr/">19th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing</a>
and stands in the tradition of the yearly <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org">SAT Competitions</a> and <a href="index.php?cat=previous">SAT-Races / Challenges</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="Objective">Objective</a></h3>
<p>
The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years.
Many problems (e.g. in hardware and software verification) that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely.
Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
</p>
<p>
To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementors to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.
